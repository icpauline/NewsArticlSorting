### 4.5
The models used for training are logistic Regression, SVC, linear SVC, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K Neighbors Classifier, Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and Bernoulli’s Naïve Bayes. Among all these methods Multinomial Naïve Bayes performed well.
### 4.6
The model's performance was assessed using accuracy score. A 97% accuracy rate was achieved via the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm
## 5. Deployment:
The model is deployed using an AWS EC2 instance. Both HTML and CSS were used to design the website. The flask API was used to deploy the model in an AWS EC2 instance.
## 6. Conclusion:
The document included a thorough description of the News Article Sorting Project. News Article Sorting will classify every news article to different categories. This is done based on the learning made by the model. The model is trained with thousands of news articles with their classification to do better prediction. The model could classify any news article with 97% accuracy.  Anyone can utilize the model because it has been installed in an AWS EC2 instance. The project can be enhanced by including user-specific recommendations.
